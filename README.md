# Control for bioreactor [chemostat] system

Run Open Loop folder files together on MATLAB for simulating dynamics of the bio-reactor system. 
Run FOPTD models folder files for build FOPTD models for the Bioreactor system.
- It builds 3 types of models: - Non-Linear fmincon based FOPTD model 
                               - Deep Neural Network FOPTD model
                               - Reaction Curve method based FOPTD model (Most accurate and used for controller tuning further)
Run Closed Loop Model to get control for 3 output variables for P, PI and PID based classical Controllers.

Results are attached in the presentation with proper details.
